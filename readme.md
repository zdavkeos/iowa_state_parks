# Iowa State Park Boundaries

This repository contains geojson files for every state park in Iowa.

Data was taken from the [Iowa DNR](www.iowadnr.gov).

Plotting the parks on [geojson.io](geojson.io) shows a few
inconsistencies from the [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org) base map.

Clicking on each geojson file should render the file as a map in Github.

See convert.py for how the data was coerced from the original SHP files. 

Loosly based on what the [NPS did for the National Parks](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/data/tree/gh-pages/base_data/boundaries/parks).
